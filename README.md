# I AM CRANSSBUCLE

* **Wants to make cool stuff.**
* Doesn't like to be told what to do
* Not **Front-End** or **Back-End**, but **Full-Slack*** 
* Collects niche stuff from the internet, like weird memes and random textfiles about phreaking or UFO philosophy
* Too much of a free soul, perhaps chaotic
* An anarchist in my playlist, a bureaucrat in life
* Loves cats morre than dogs, but both more than people
* Owner of a plethora of defunct communities about the nerdiest things
* One of the smartest layman
* Wiseman in terms of internet history, completely unaware of historic events before WWII
* Gets too angry at multiplayer games


*Not a typo, it's slack.
